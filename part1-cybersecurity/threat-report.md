# Threat Intelligence Report

## 1. Types of Attacks That Could Be Used

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Allows attackers to run arbitrary commands on a server due to poor input sanitization or insecure deserialization.
- **SQL Injection:** Manipulates backend SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL through user input fields.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Executes scripts in the victim's browser to steal session cookies or redirect users.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers exploit bugs to gain higher-level permissions on the system.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Attackers use known username/password pairs from other breaches to gain unauthorized access.

## 2. How Exploited Vulnerability Leads to Network Access

When a web application has an unpatched vulnerability (e.g., outdated library or insecure API endpoint), attackers can:
- Send specially crafted HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerability.
- Execute commands or inject malicious payloads (e.g., web shells, reverse shells).
- Gain initial foothold and use lateral movement techniques to pivot through the internal network.
- Exploit insecure protocols, weak credentials, or poor segmentation to access databases, file shares, or internal APIs.

## 3. Preventive Measures

- **Regular Patching:** Automate vulnerability scanning and apply updates for OS, libraries, and dependencies.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Detect and block malicious HTTP traffic patterns.
- **Least Privilege Access:** Restrict access based on role using IAM policies; avoid excessive permissions.
- **Static and Dynamic Code Analysis:** Integrate tools like SonarQube, Snyk, or OWASP Dependency Check into CI/CD.
- **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA):** Validate identity and device posture before allowing internal resource access.
