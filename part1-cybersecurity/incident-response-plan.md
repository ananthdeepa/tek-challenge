# Incident Response Plan

## Objective
Effectively identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from the recent security breach in the web application.

## 1. Preparation
- Maintain updated incident response playbooks.
- Ensure all team members are trained on security procedures.
- Enable logging and alerting through tools like AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and Security Hub.

## 2. Identification
- Detect anomalous activity from logs, IDS/IPS alerts, or user reports.
- Analyze logs to identify compromised systems or entry points.

## 3. Containment
- **Short-term:**
  - Isolate affected servers/subnets (security group modification or quarantine).
  - Terminate suspicious sessions or reverse shells.
- **Long-term:**
  - Disable exposed API endpoints or take vulnerable applications offline temporarily.
  - Revoke credentials or session tokens involved in the breach.

## 4. Eradication
- Identify root cause vulnerability (e.g., CVE in web framework).
- Remove all attacker persistence mechanisms like cron jobs, scripts, backdoors.
- Apply necessary patches and harden configurations.

## 5. Recovery
- Restore applications from clean, trusted backups or AMIs.
- Monitor restored systems for signs of re-compromise.
- Slowly return systems to production with enhanced monitoring.

## 6. Lessons Learned
- Conduct a post-incident review and update playbooks accordingly.
- Share findings with dev teams to ensure secure coding practices.
- Perform tabletop simulation to validate improvements.
